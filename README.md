## Example Output (Tested with Google Gemini)

### Idea: Breaking the "Blank Page" Curse

**Hook:**  
Writer’s block is officially a choice.

**Explanation:**  
In 2026, staring at a blinking cursor is a waste of your talent. I’ve shifted my workflow: I don't ask AI to "write this for me." I ask it to "challenge this argument," "outline three perspectives," or "find the gaps in this strategy." It’s not a ghostwriter; it’s the world’s fastest brainstorming partner.

**Call to Action:**  
Do you use AI more for generating new ideas or refining the ones you already have?
